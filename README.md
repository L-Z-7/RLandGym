# RLandGym

My GYM for reinforcement learning.

I use the environment [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) from OpenAI to train the reinforcement learning model and also to *reinforce* my coding skills.

## Files

1. Agent: Contains the implementation of all agents.
    1. utils.py: Contains *Logging* and *Replaybuffer*.
    2. a2c.py: Implementation of *A2C* in *CartPole-v1*.
2. .gitignore: The files and dirs should be ignored by *Git*.
